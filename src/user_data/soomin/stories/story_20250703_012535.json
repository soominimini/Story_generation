  "story": "**Anna's Big Adventure**\n\nAnna was excited to go on a picnic. She packed a big basket with yummy sandwiches, juicy apples, and sweet cookies.\n\nAs she walked to the park, Anna saw a beautiful garden filled with bright flowers. \"Wow! Look at all the pretty **pink** roses!\" she said. There were also tall trees with soft green leaves that whispered in the wind.\n\nBut when Anna got to the park, she realized she had forgotten her blanket. She needed something big and warm to sit on. Just then, her friend Emma appeared. \"Hey, Anna! I have a special surprise for you.\" Emma showed Anna a huge, fluffy **blue** blanket with white spots. \"Isn't it soft and cozy?\" Emma asked.\n\nAnna's face lit up. \"Yes! It's perfect!\" But now they had to find a nice spot to sit. They walked through the park and saw many people playing games and running around. Then, they came across a big **red** swing hanging from a sturdy tree branch. \"Let's sit here,\" said Emma.\n\nAs they sat on the blanket under the swing, Anna felt happy and content. She munched on her sandwich and took a bite of her apple. The sun shone brightly, and the flowers swayed gently in the breeze. It was the perfect picnic!\n\nAnna hugged Emma and said, \"Thank you for bringing me my special blanket!\" Emma smiled and replied, \"I'm glad I could help.\"\n\nThe end.\n\n**Therapy goals integrated naturally into the story:**\n\n1. **Learning descriptive words:** Anna uses descriptive words like \"pink\", \"pretty\", \"big\", \"soft\", \"green\", \"bright\", and \"yummy\" to describe what she sees and experiences.\n2. **Practicing plural forms:** Emma shows Anna her blanket with white **spots** (plural form), and they sit under a tree branch with many leaves swaying in the wind.\n3. **Understanding spatial concepts:** Anna and Emma move through the park, finding different spots to sit (under the swing) and experiencing changes in their surroundings (the flowers swaying gently in the breeze).",
