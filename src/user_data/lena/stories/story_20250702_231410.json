  "story": "Anna's Big Adventure\n\nAnna loved playing outside. One sunny day, she decided to go on a special journey to find the most beautiful butterfly garden in her town. She packed a small bag with some yummy snacks and put on her favorite hat.\n\nAs Anna walked through the park, she saw many big trees with tall trunks and wide leaves that looked like giant fans. The sun shone brightly overhead, making everything feel warm and happy.\n\nBut then, Anna met a little obstacle: a tiny stream blocked her path! She didn't know how to cross it. Just as she was thinking of what to do, she saw a friendly fish swimming in the water.\n\n\"Hello there!\" said the fish. \"My name is Finley. What are you doing?\"\n\nAnna explained that she was on her way to find the butterfly garden. Finley smiled and said, \"I can help! Follow me!\"\n\nFinley showed Anna how to use stepping stones to cross the stream. On the other side, they met a kind squirrel named Squeaky.\n\n\"Welcome!\" said Squeaky. \"I have some delicious acorns for you! And look, there are many butterflies in my garden. You can see them flying around the big flowers that bloom everywhere!\"\n\nAnna was so happy to finally find the butterfly garden. She thanked Finley and Squeaky for their help. Together, they watched the beautiful butterflies dance around the colorful flowers.\n\nAs Anna left the garden, she felt proud of herself for being brave and asking for help when she needed it. And she knew that she would always remember her big adventure with Finley and Squeaky.\n\n(Note: The story integrates speech and language therapy goals naturally into the narrative.)\n\n* Descriptive words:\n\t+ big trees\n\t+ tall trunks\n\t+ wide leaves\n\t+ giant fans\n\t+ sunny day\n\t+ warm and happy\n\t+ tiny stream\n\t+ stepping stones\n\t+ colorful flowers\n* Plural forms:\n\t+ trees (multiple)\n\t+ leaves (multiple)\n\t+ fish (plural form of \"fish\")\n\t+ butterflies (plural form of \"butterfly\")\n\t+ acorns (plural form of \"acorn\")\n* Spatial concepts:\n\t+ on top of something (tree trunks)\n\t+ under something (stepping stones)\n\t+ in front of/behind something (stream, garden)",
